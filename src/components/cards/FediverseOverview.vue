          The Fediverse consists of a number of protocols and servers that offer
          improvements over the big tech options. Like the big tech options, you
          may need to use multiple services to cover all your needs. Unlike the
          big tech options, the Fediverse can provide a base level of
          connectivity between those services using the ActivityPub protocol.
