# About Izzup

[[toc]]

Izzup provides an easy on-ramp to the Fediverse, and additional features to help grow a community.

## Membership

Membership is free and open to anyone, there is more information under financing on how we plan to keep it free.

## Financing

Providing Fediverse and sharing services is not cheap, there is a fair amount of bandwidth and storage involved. We will fund the free Fediverse service by profits from the community sharing tools.

## Governance

The members will vote on all issues.

## Fediverse

We provide Fediverse services using existing open source software. We will purposefull avoid anything that would make our Fediverse server non-compliant or proprietary.

### Fediverse Server

We use [GotoSocial](https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/) as the server component. It is a lightweight, yet powerful ActvityPub server written in Go. It is highly compatible with Mastodon servers.

### Fediverse client

On the Fediverse client side use our own ["Antlers"](https://github.com/Ultri-Izzup/antlers), a fork the amazing [Elk](https://github.com/elk-zone/elk) Vue 3 / Quasar application.

## Community Sharing

We are building a number of additional sharing services, loosely coupled to the Fediverse.

* Classified Sales (CraigsList / Facebook Marketplace)
* Community Curated Global News and Events
* Group Forums (Discord / Reddit)
  * Group Decision Making (Loomio)
  * Group Dashboards (Notion)
  * Event Calendar and Ticketing (Meetup)
* Personal Publishing ( Medium / Dev.to)
* Business Pages with Fediverse integration (Facebook Page)
* Job Posting (Monster, etc)
* Microsites with Custom Domains (Wix)
