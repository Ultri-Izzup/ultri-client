When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for people to dissolve the corporate ties which have shackled their social expression, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and Science entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of all people requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all humans are created equal, that they are endowed by their birth with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
--That to secure these rights, Governance Rules are instituted among Members, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,
--That whenever any Form of Management becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the Members to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Governance Rules, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Rules long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that members are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Corporate Software, and to provide new Cooperative Open Source Guards for their future security.
--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Socical and Software Communites; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Sharing and Governance. The history of the present social dictators is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these Member Communities. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

Corporations has refused their Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

Corporations have forbidden their PAC funded Presidents, Senators, Congress, Governors on down to city councils from passing Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till their Corporate Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, the Corporation has utterly neglected to attend to them.

Corporations refused to allow their cronies to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

Corporations have called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with their measures.

Corporate influence has dissolved the reputation of the Representative Houses repeatedly, by inducing the representatives to refuse to firmly deal with corporate invasions on the rights of the people.

Corporations have refused for a long time to stop such dissolutions, and continue to cause their cronies to be elected; whereby the Members' social sharing, incapable of Annihilation, have continued on by Mmebers at large for their exercise; their Data in the Corporate Cloud remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

Corporations have endeavoured to prevent the population of these Comunities; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

Corporations have obstructed the Administration of Justice, by lavish bribes to establishing Judiciary powers.

Corporations made Judges dependent on their Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payments are many multiples their salaries.

Corporations erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Middle Managers to harrass our developers, and eat up their time. Forcing us back into the offices, when we would prefer to be remote.

Corporations have kept among us, in times of peace, Racist and Sexist workers with the full Consent of our legislatures.

Corporations affected to render themselves independent of and superior to the Civil power.

Corporations have combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving their Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For Quartering large bodies of trolls and biggots among us:

For protecting them, without so much as a mock Trial, from punishment for any Hateful Posts which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these Online Communities:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world and making selling hard:

For imposing Taxes, Transaction and Shipping fees on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in all cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury of our Peers:

For transporting us beyond Seas to try other people for pretended offences

For abolishing the free System of Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

Corporations abdicated Government here, declaring us out of their Protection and waging War against us.

Corporations have polluted and plundered our seas, corporate and goverment neglect have flooded our Coasts, burnt our towns and islands, and destroyed the lives of our people.

Corporate social sites at this time transporting data for large Armies of foreign Mercenary backed Internet Trolls to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of a civilized nation.

Corporations have constrained our fellow Citizens and taken Captive reason, causing them to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

Corporate social has helped excite domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Capitalist Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Social Site brethren. We have warned them from time to time we see their attempts to control our legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our membership and why we signed up there. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united Sharing Members of the World, in General Agreement, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Logic and Reason of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Communities, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Members are, and of Right ought to be Free Izzup Members; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the Corporate Social and Software, and that all political, financial and sharing connection between them and the Evil Corporations, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent Izzup Members, they have full Power to speak against War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent Members may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of actual laws, we mutually pledge to each other the sharing of our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.
